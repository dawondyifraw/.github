# Daniel Wonyifraw 👋

🧠 Data Engineering • 🤖 Machine Learning • 🏗️ Software Architecture

I build **data-intensive software systems** at the intersection of **data engineering**, **machine learning**, and **software architecture**. My work is production-oriented: messy data, latency, scale, reliability, and systems that remain understandable long after the demo stops impressing people.

- 🎓 **Background:** Engineering Doctorate (EngD) in Data Science  
- 🔬 **Core interests:** streaming platforms, digital twins, spatiotemporal systems, applied AI  
- 🐍 **Primary ecosystem:** Python (open, inspectable, production-first)

---

## 🔬 Research and applied work

My work is **implementation-driven** and focused on operational relevance. A central project is the design and development of an **Urban Digital Twin** for the City of ’s-Hertogenbosch, integrating:

- real-time streaming pipelines  
- geospatial and spatiotemporal data processing  
- time-series storage and analytics  
- forecasting and machine-learning models  
- interactive 3D visualization for exploration and decision support  

The system is designed as a living platform rather than a static model. This work has been presented in academic and professional venues and continues to evolve toward real-world deployment.

## 🧪 Research interests

My research sits at the boundary between systems engineering and data science:

- real-time and streaming analytics  
- data integration and interoperability  
- federated and distributed data processing  
- ML deployment, evaluation, and monitoring in production  
- reliability, scalability, and reproducibility of data-driven systems  

Architectural choices often dominate model performance. That is where I spend my time.

## 🏗️ Engineering principles

I prefer systems that are:

- **composable** — replaceable parts, minimal lock-in  
- **explicit** — clear interfaces and data contracts  
- **inspectable** — debuggable without folklore  
- **maintainable** — designed for the second year, not the second week  

Complexity should be visible, not hidden.

---

## 🌍 Open source

I am an open-source practitioner, primarily within the **Python ecosystem**. I value clarity over cleverness and reproducibility over novelty. If a system cannot be reasoned about, it does not scale.

---

## 🤝 Collaboration

Through **DataTwinLabs**, I collaborate with public organizations and industry partners on data platforms, digital twins, and applied AI systems.

I am open to collaboration on research, engineering, and applied projects where data meets real-world systems.
